## Overview

This is a simple solution to the QR code component challenge by Frontend Mentor. The project consists of a card component with a centered QR code and some descriptive text. It was built with semantic HTML and CSS, following a mobile-first approach. It helped me strengthen my layout and styling skills using Flexbox and custom properties.

## My process

I built the layout using semantic HTML and styled it with CSS and Flexbox. I initially had trouble importing the font because I used the wrong Google Fonts link, but fixed it by updating the <link> tag. Then I adjusted spacing, colors, and typography to match the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me reinforce the importance of semantic HTML structure and responsive layout with Flexbox. I also practiced importing Google Fonts and organizing a simple component visually centered on the screen.

```html
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```
